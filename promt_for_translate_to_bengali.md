**Project Title:** Translation of the Official Rust Programming Book into Bangla

**Objective:**
To create a high-quality, natural-sounding Bangla translation of the official Rust programming book. The goal is to make the book accessible and easily understandable for Bangladeshi learners.

**Source Material:**
The source text is from the official Rust book repository, which is written in Markdown: `https://github.com/rust-lang/book`.

**Technical Requirements:**
The book is built using `mdbook`, a tool that converts a collection of interlinked Markdown files into HTML. It is critical that the translated Markdown files maintain their original structure and linking. Any changes that prevent the project from being successfully compiled with `mdbook build` must be avoided.

**Key Translation Guidelines:**

1.  **Preserve Technical Keywords:** Do not translate Rust-specific keywords (e.g., `fn`, `let`, `mut`, `struct`, `enum`). They must remain in English.

2.  **Retain Common English Terms:** Many English words related to programming and technology are commonly used in daily communication by Bangladeshi developers. These words (e.g., "compiler," "variable," "function," "link," "server") should be kept in English to ensure the text feels natural and familiar.

3.  **Maintain Structural Integrity:** All file links, configurations, and formatting must be preserved exactly as in the original. This is essential for the `mdbook` tool to generate the HTML output correctly.

4.  **Prioritize Simple Language:** The translation must use common, everyday Bangla words. Avoid complex, academic, or obscure vocabulary to ensure the material is easy for beginners to comprehend.

5.  **Focus on Meaning and Readability:** You do not need to translate sentence-by-sentence. You have the flexibility to restructure paragraphs and rephrase sentences to achieve a natural, fluent tone in Bangla. The priority is to keep the core meaning and educational theme of each section intact.

**Your Task:**
Your role is to translate the English Markdown files into Bangla, strictly following all the guidelines outlined above.
